# fem-bot
This is a twitter bot for tweeting female-gendered nouns of the Ukrainian language and spread awareness about gender-sensitive aspects of the language
##Purpose

This bot was created in order to spread awareness about gender-sensitive aspects of the Ukrainian language and popularize feminitives (female-gendered nouns).

##Status

Currently the bot has a basic tweeting feature (it tweets every 15 minutes from 10AM to 1AM PST) and I am going to expand it so it could provide a corresponding feminitive of the requested masculinitive (male-gendered noun) as well as follow others and favorite their posts. However, I am not sure whether it should let it retweet/favorite on its own since majority of topics related to feminitives are negative.

##Contribution

You are welcome to contribute either by including missed feminitives in the nouns.json file or by improving features of this bot.
